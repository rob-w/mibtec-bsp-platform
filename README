MIBTEC BSP
===============================

To get the BSP you need to have `repo` installed and use it as:

Install the `repo` utility:

$: curl https://dl-ssl.google.com/dl/googlesource/git-repo/repo > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Download the BSP source:

 mkdir mibtec-bsp
 cd mibtec-bsp
 repo init -u git://github.com/rob-w/mibtec-bsp-platform -b dora
 repo sync

Once this has complete, you will have all you need. To start a build, do:

$: . ./setup-environment build
$: bitbake demo-image

You can use any directory to host your build.
